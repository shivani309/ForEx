# ForEx forecasting framework

## Introduction 

This project aims to improve Forex forecasting by addressing limitations in existing methodologies. By leveraging a dataset spanning the last 10 years, we capture long-term market trends, focusing specifically on the four major currency pairs used by Indian traders: USD/INR, EUR/INR, GBP/INR, and JPY/INR. The framework is tailored for swing trading, supporting positions held over days to weeks. A key contribution is the creation of the Swing Technical Indicators Library, designed to aid in market analysis and provide actionable insights.
